&= (Bitwise AND assignment): Performs a bitwise AND operation between the left-hand side operand and the right-hand side operand, and assigns the result back to the left-hand side operand.

cpp
Copy code
int a = 10;  // binary: 1010
int b = 6;   // binary: 0110

a &= b;      // Perform bitwise AND between a and b, and assign the result back to a

// The value of a is now 2 (binary: 0010)
|= (Bitwise OR assignment): Performs a bitwise OR operation between the left-hand side operand and the right-hand side operand, and assigns the result back to the left-hand side operand.

cpp
Copy code
int a = 10;  // binary: 1010
int b = 6;   // binary: 0110

a |= b;      // Perform bitwise OR between a and b, and assign the result back to a

// The value of a is now 14 (binary: 1110)
*= (Multiplication assignment): Multiplies the left-hand side operand by the right-hand side operand, and assigns the result back to the left-hand side operand.

cpp
Copy code
int a = 5;
int b = 3;

a *= b;      // Multiply a by b, and assign the result back to a

// The value of a is now 15
<<= (Left shift assignment): Shifts the bits of the left-hand side operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right-hand side operand, and assigns the result back to the left-hand side operand.

cpp
Copy code
int a = 5;   // binary: 0101

a <<= 2;     // Left shift a by 2 positions, and assign the result back to a

// The value of a is now 20 (binary: 10100)
>>= (Right shift assignment): Shifts the bits of the left-hand side operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right-hand side operand, and assigns the result back to the left-hand side operand.

cpp
Copy code
int a = 20;  // binary: 10100

a >>= 2;     // Right shift a by 2 positions, and assign the result back to a

// The value of a is now 5 (binary: 0101)

Yes, there are additional bitwise operators similar to <<=, >>=, and &=. Here are some commonly used bitwise operators:

<< (Left Shift Operator): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand. This is equivalent to multiplying the left operand by 2 raised to the power of the right operand.

Example: int result = 10 << 2; // result = 40

>> (Right Shift Operator): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand. This is equivalent to dividing the left operand by 2 raised to the power of the right operand.

Example: int result = 10 >> 2; // result = 2

| (Bitwise OR Operator): Performs a bitwise OR operation between the corresponding bits of the two operands.

Example: int result = 5 | 3; // result = 7

^ (Bitwise XOR Operator): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between the corresponding bits of the two operands. The result is 1 if the corresponding bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.

Example: int result = 5 ^ 3; // result = 6

~ (Bitwise NOT Operator): Flips the bits of the operand. It changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

Example: int result = ~5; // result = -6 (Assuming 32-bit integers)

These operators, along with the <<=, >>=, and &= operators you mentioned earlier, are used to perform various bitwise operations on integer values. They manipulate the individual bits of the operands based on specific rules defined by the operator.

Apologies for missing the additional bitwise operators. Here are a few more commonly used bitwise operators:

& (Bitwise AND Operator): Performs a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding bits of the two operands.

Example: int result = 5 & 3; // result = 1

|= (Bitwise OR Assignment Operator): Performs a bitwise OR operation between the operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

Example: int value = 5; value |= 3; // value = 7

^= (Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator): Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

Example: int value = 5; value ^= 3; // value = 6

~= (Bitwise NOT Assignment Operator): Flips the bits of the operand and assigns the result to the operand.

Example: int value = 5; value ~= value; // value = -6 (Assuming 32-bit integers)
