can i overload any operator , operator like '~' ?
ChatGPT
In C++, not all operators can be overloaded. The set of operators that can be overloaded is fixed by the C++ language and does not include operators like the logical NOT operator (!) or the bitwise NOT operator (~).

The following operators can be overloaded in C++:

Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
Increment and decrement operators: ++, --
Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical operators: &&, ||
Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, <<, >>
Subscript operator: []
Function call operator: ()
Member access operators: ->, ->*
Conversion operators
As you can see, the logical NOT operator (!) and the bitwise NOT operator (~) are not in the list of overloadable operators.

So, in C++, you cannot directly overload the ~ operator.
