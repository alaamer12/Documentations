what about if it is declared at protected scope
ChatGPT
If the constructor is declared in the protected scope of a class, it means that the constructor can be accessed and invoked by the derived classes, but not by the objects or functions outside the class hierarchy.

Here's an example to demonstrate the behavior:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

class Base {
protected:
    Base() {
        std::cout << "Base constructor called." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void createObject() {
        Derived obj;  // Invoking the protected constructor within the derived class
    }
};

int main() {
    // Base obj;  // Error: Cannot directly create object using a protected constructor

    Derived derivedObj;
    derivedObj.createObject();

    return 0;
}
In this example, the Base class has a protected constructor. The Derived class, being derived from Base, can access and invoke the protected constructor within its member functions. However, attempting to create an object of the Base class directly in the main function will result in a compilation error since the protected constructor is not accessible from outside the class hierarchy.

The protected constructor allows derived classes to initialize the base class part of their objects while controlling access to the constructor from outside the class hierarchy.
