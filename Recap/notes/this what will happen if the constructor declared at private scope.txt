what will happen if the constructor used in private scope , does this will make a differnce?
ChatGPT
If the constructor is declared in the private scope of a class, it means that only the members and friend functions of that class can access and invoke the constructor. Objects cannot be directly created using a private constructor outside the class.

Here's an example to illustrate the behavior:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
private:
    int value;

    MyClass(int val) : value(val) {}

public:
    int getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    friend class FriendClass;
};

class FriendClass {
public:
    void createObject() {
        MyClass obj(42);  // Invoking the private constructor within the friend class
        std::cout << "Value: " << obj.getValue() << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // MyClass obj(42);  // Error: Cannot directly create object using a private constructor

    FriendClass friendObj;
    friendObj.createObject();

    return 0;
}
In this example, the MyClass has a private constructor, which can only be accessed by the FriendClass as it is declared as a friend of MyClass. The FriendClass can create objects of MyClass by invoking the private constructor.

Attempting to create an object of MyClass directly in the main function will result in a compilation error since the constructor is not accessible from outside the class.
