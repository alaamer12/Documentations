there's something i dont understand why some services prefer to use xml, yaml, json, toml, ...etc.
i mean what are the differences that makes the vendors to choose one of those or other one

The choice of data format like XML, YAML, JSON, TOML, etc., often depends on factors such as readability, ease of use, and specific requirements of the application or service.

XML is extensible and widely used, especially in web services. It's hierarchical and supports complex structures, but it can be verbose.

JSON is lightweight, easy to read, and has broad support in modern programming languages. It's commonly used for web APIs and configuration files.

YAML is human-readable and often preferred for configuration files due to its simplicity. It uses indentation for structure and is less verbose than XML.

TOML is designed for configuration files as well, emphasizing readability and ease of writing. It's more strict and straightforward compared to YAML.

The choice often comes down to the specific needs of the application, ease of parsing, human readability, and existing conventions in the development community.

this is not good answer at all , u havent cleared the pros and cons , u havent cleared why this one is preferred over this , uhavent cleared why a vendor would like to use this , u havent cleared why vendor would prefer this , u havent cleared why in common service they usually use same data format (like github actions, circleci, travisci all used yaml) ,u have not cleared why in this situation or service all or almodt all of them preferred this data format (e.g. yaml) over the others

I appreciate your feedback. Let's delve deeper into the reasons why certain data formats are preferred in specific contexts:

Readability:

XML: Hierarchical structure can be hard to read due to tags.
JSON: Lightweight and easy to read, but can be verbose for large configurations.
YAML: Human-readable and less verbose due to indentation.
TOML: Simple and clean, focused on readability.
Ease of Use:

XML: More complex due to the need for opening and closing tags.
JSON: Straightforward key-value pairs.
YAML: Intuitive indentation for structure.
TOML: Simple syntax with minimal rules.
Language Support:

JSON: Native support in many programming languages.
YAML: Widely supported, especially in scripting languages.
TOML: Growing support but not as universal as JSON or YAML.
Use Cases:

XML: Often used in situations requiring strict validation and complex data structures (e.g., SOAP services).
JSON: Commonly used in web APIs and JavaScript applications.
YAML: Popular for configuration files and data serialization due to its readability.
TOML: Emerging as a preferred choice for configuration files, particularly in Rust and Go communities.
Community Standards:

GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Travis CI: YAML is a common choice due to its simplicity, readability, and widespread use in the DevOps community. It becomes a de facto standard, making it easier for users to understand and adopt these tools.
Ecosystem and Tooling:

The availability of libraries and tools for parsing and generating a particular format influences the choice. If there are well-established libraries for a format in a given programming language, it may sway the decision.
Historical Reasons:

Sometimes, the choice of a particular format is based on historical reasons, existing standards, or backward compatibility with older systems.
Expressiveness and Extensibility:

XML is extensible and can represent complex structures with attributes.
JSON is simpler but may lack some features for expressing metadata.
YAML balances simplicity with expressiveness, making it suitable for configuration.
In the context of services like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Travis CI using YAML, it can be attributed to the simplicity, readability, and widespread acceptance of YAML in the DevOps and configuration management space. Once a standard is established and widely adopted, it creates a network effect where users and services align to maintain consistency and interoperability.
