Caching

Tools: Varnish Cache, Redis, Memcached
Purpose: Improving response times by caching frequently requested data or content.
Monitoring and Logging

Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), New Relic
Purpose: Monitoring system performance, tracking errors, and gaining insights into application behavior.
Security

Tools: Fail2Ban, ModSecurity, Let's Encrypt (for SSL/TLS)
Purpose: Protecting against security threats, monitoring for suspicious activities, and encrypting communication.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions
Purpose: Automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications, ensuring a streamlined development pipeline.
Authentication and Authorization

Tools: OAuth, OpenID Connect, JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Purpose: Implementing secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Tools: ModSecurity, Cloudflare WAF
Purpose: Protecting web applications from various web-based attacks.
