To ensure that your Windows game will work on different versions of Windows, you can perform compatibility testing on various versions of Windows. Here are some steps to follow:

Test on the latest version of Windows: You can start by testing your game on the latest version of Windows, which is Windows 10. If your game runs smoothly on Windows 10, there's a good chance it will work on earlier versions of Windows.

Test on earlier versions of Windows: You can also test your game on earlier versions of Windows, such as Windows 7 and Windows 8. This will help you determine if there are any compatibility issues with these versions of Windows.

Use a virtual machine: You can also use a virtual machine to test your game on different versions of Windows. A virtual machine is a software that allows you to run a different operating system within your current operating system. You can use software like VirtualBox or VMware to create a virtual machine and install different versions of Windows on it.

Check system requirements: Make sure your game's system requirements are clearly stated and that they include the minimum and recommended versions of Windows.

Use Microsoft compatibility tools: Microsoft provides tools to check compatibility of software, one such tool is the Application Compatibility Toolkit. You can use this tool to identify any compatibility issues with different versions of Windows.

By following these steps, you can help ensure that your game will work on different versions of Windows.
